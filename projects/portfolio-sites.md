Erick reached out for me to help clean up his portfolio website. He was using a Jekyl theme where the navigation was based on a hamburger menu (even on desktop!) and was concerned about clarity and accessibility. Instead of fighting the existing theme, I quickly made my own templates. We both appreciate the simplicity of minimally-styled HTML pages so I kept it as simple as possible while maintaining readability and mobile-responsiveness.

Colin wanted a facelift for his portfolio site and I was happy to help. Of note is the javscript-free hamburger menu for mobile browsing, dark mode, and fully responsive splash images that look great on any sized screen.

Believe it or not, I also made this site.
