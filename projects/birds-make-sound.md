This was originally on [Blogger](https://birdsmakesound.blogspot.com/), but I never felt satisfied with the available themes so I recreated it “from scratch” using HTML and CSS.

Using 11ty static site generator, I converted the HTML and CSS to Nunjucks templates, allowing simple updates in Markdown. For improved user experience, I created shortcodes for Eleventy-img to automatically resize and display the optimally sized images depending on the user’s screen size.
