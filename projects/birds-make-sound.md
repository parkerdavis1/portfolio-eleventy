This was originally on [Blogger](https://birdsmakesound.blogspot.com/), but I never felt satisfied with the available themes so I recreated it “from scratch” using HTML and CSS.

Using 11ty static site generator, I converted the HTML and CSS to Nunjucks templates. New posts can be written in Markdown. All images are automatically resized and optimized for viewing on different screensizes using Eleventy-img and custom-written eleventy shortcodes.
